# 🚗 My-Tumaride

My-Tumaride is a React Native mobile app I built to gain experience working with front-end, contexts, hooks, and general mobile app structure.

## 🛠 Tech Stack & Structure

- React Native + TypeScript  
- Uses **contexts** for app-wide state management  
- Custom **hooks** for reusable logic  
- Organized folders:  
  - `components/` — UI components  
  - `contexts/` — state logic shared across screens  
  - `hooks/` — reusable logic  
  - `assets/images/` — images & visual assets

## 🚀 What’s Done

- Basic screens & navigation setup  
- Components structured and styled  
- State management using contexts  
- Custom hooks implemented for parts of logic
